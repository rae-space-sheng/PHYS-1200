**Example 1:** Plotting Projectile Motion  
* **Objective:** Write a program to calculate the horizontal and vertical positions of a projectile at different time intervals, given its initial velocity and launch angle. Then make a plot of x vs t, y vs t and x vs y using subplots. Try different formats for your plots.  
* **Instructions:**  
  * Import the NumPy library.
  * Define variables for the initial velocity (v0), launch angle (theta), and acceleration due to gravity (g, with a value of 9.81 m/sÂ²).Convert the launch angle from degrees to radians.
  * Calculate the total time and assign it to a variable (time). Create a NumPy array time_intervals to represent different time intervals (in seconds) starting from zero to total-time.
  * Calculate the arrays for horizontal position (x_t) and the vertical position (y_t).
  * Plot x vs time_intervals, y vs time_intervals and x vs y using subplots. Make sure your axis are labeled and your plots are titled.  
  
The subplot and subplots images were created using velocity 50 m/s and launch angle 50 degrees.
