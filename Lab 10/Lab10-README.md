**Example 1:** Numerical Integration  
* **Instructions:**  
  * Integrate f(x) = x^2 from x = 0 to x = 2 and check the results.  
  * Evaluate the integral from 0 to x-max with an integrand of e^(-x^2/2)dx from x = 0 to x = 5 and plot the results.  
  * Can quad handle infinite limits? Use -np.inf and np.inf as limits to evaluate the integral from -infinity to infinity with an integrand of e^(-x^2/2)dx. Compare to the exact result: sqrt(2pi).
